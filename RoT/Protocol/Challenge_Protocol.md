# Summary

Throughout this document, the term "Processor" refers to all Central
Processing Unit (CPU), System On Chip (SOC), Micro Control Unit (MCU),
and Microprocessor architectures. The document details the required
challenge protocol required for Active Component and Platform RoTs. The
Processor must implement all required features to establish a hardware
based Root of Trust. Processors that intrinsically fail to meet these
requirements must implement the flash protection Cerberus RoT described
Physical Flash Protection Requirements document.

Active Components are add-in cards and peripherals that contain
Processors, Microcontrollers or devices that run soft-logic.

This document describes the protocol used for attestation measurements
of firmware for the Platform's Active RoT. The specification encompasses
the pre-boot, boot and runtime challenge and verification of platform
firmware integrity. The hierarchical architecture extends beyond the
typically UEFI measurements, to include integrity measurements of all
Active Component firmware. The document describes the APIs needed to
support the attestation challenge for Project Cerberus.

# Physical Communication Channel

The typically cloud server motherboard layout has I2C buses routed to
all Active Components. These I2C buses are typically used by the
Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) for the thermal monitoring of
Active Components. In the Cerberus board layout, the I2C lanes are first
used by the platform Cerberus microcontroller during boot and pre-boot,
then later mux switched back to the BMC for thermal management. Cerberus
can at any time request for the BMC to yield control for runtime
challenge and attestation. Cerberus controls the I2C mux position, and
coordinates access during runtime. It is also possible for Cerberus to
proxy commands through the BMC at runtime, with the option for link
encryption and asymmetric key exchange, making the BMC blind to the
communications. The Cerberus microcontroller on the motherboard is
referred to as the Platform Active Root-of-Trust (PA-RoT). This
microcontroller is head of the hierarchical root-of-trust platform
design and contains an attestable hash of all platform firmware kept in
the Platform Firmware Manifest (PFM) and Component Firmware Manifest
(CFM).

Most cloud server motherboards route I2C to Active Components for
thermal monitoring, the addition of the mux logic is the only
modification to the motherboard. An alternative to adding the additional
mux, is to tunnel a secure challenge channel through the BMC over I2C.
Once the BMC has been loaded and attested by Cerberus, it can act as an
I2C proxy. This approach is less desirable, as it limits platform
attestation should the BMC ever fail attestation. In either approach,
physical connectors to Active Component interfaces do not need to change
as they already have I2C.

Active Components with the intrinsic security attributes described in
the "Processor Secure Boot Requirements" document do not need to place
the physical Cerberus microcontroller between their Processor and Flash.
Active Components that do not meet the requirements described in the
"Processor Secure Boot Requirements" document are required to implement
the Cerberus micro-controller between their Processor and Flash to
establish the needed Root-of-Trust. Figure 1 Motherboard I2C lane
diagram, represents the pre-boot and post-boot measurement challenge
channels between the motherboard PA-RoT and Active Component RoTs
(AC-RoT).

<!-- TODO: ![](media/image3.png) -->

The Project Cerberus firmware attestation is a hierarchical
architecture. Most Active Components in the modern server boot to an
operational level before the platform's host processors complete their
initialization and become capable of challenging the devices. In the
Cerberus design, the platform is held in pre-power-on or reset state,
whereby Active Components are quarantined and challenged for their
firmware measurements. Active Components must respond to challenges from
the PA-RoT confirming the integrity of their firmware before they are
taken out of quarantine.

In this version of the Cerberus platform design, the PFM and CFMs are
static. The manifest is programmable through the PA-RoT's communication
interface. Auto-detection of Active Components and computation of the
PFM/CFM will be considered in future version of the specification. The
PFM and CFM are manifests of allowed firmware versions and their
corresponding firmware measurements. The manifests contain a monotonic
identifier used to restrict rollbacks.

The PA-RoT uses the measurements in the CFM to challenge the Active
Components and compare their measurements. The PA-RoT then uses the
digest of these measurements as the platform level measurement, creating
a hierarchical platform level digest that can attest the integrity of
the platform and active component firmware.

The PA-RoT will support Authentication, Integrity and Confidentiality of
messages. Active Components RoT's (AC-RoT) will support Authentication
and Integrity of messages and challenges. To facilitate this, AC-RoT are
required to support certificate authentication. The Active Component
will support a component unique CA signed challenge certificate for
authentication.

Note: I2C is a low speed link, there is a performance tradeoff between
optimizing the protocol messages and strong cryptographic hashing
algorithms that carry higher bit counts. RoT's that cannot support
certificate authentication are required to support hashing algorithms
and either RSA or ECDSA signatures of firmware measurements.

## Power Control

In the Cerberus motherboard design, power and reset sequencing is
orchestrated by the PA-RoT. When voltage is applied to the motherboard,
it passes through in-rush circuity to a CPLD that performs time
sensitive sequencing of power rails to ensure stabilization. Once a
power good level is established, the platform is considered powered on.
Upon initial powering of the platform in the Cerberus design, the only
active component powered-on is the PA- RoT. The RoT first securely loads
and decompresses its internal firmware, then verifies the integrity of
Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) firmware by measuring the BMC
flash. When the BMC firmware has been authenticated, the Active RoT
enables power to be applied to the BMC. Once the BMC has been powered,
the Active RoT authenticates the firmware for the platform UEFI, during
which time the RoT sequences power to the PCIe slots and begins Active
Component RoT challenge. When the UEFI has been authenticated, the
platform is held in system reset and the Active RoT will keep the system
in reset until AC-RoTs have responded to the measurement challenge. Any
PCIe ports that do not respond to their measurement challenge will be
subsequently unpowered. Should any of the expected Active Components
fail to respond to the measurement challenge, Cerberus policies
determine whether the system should boot with the Active Component
powered off, or the platform should remain on standby power, while
reporting the measurement failure to the Data Center Management Software
through the OOB path.

# Communication 

The Cerberus PA-RoT communicates with the AC-RoT's over I2C. The
protocol supports an authentication and measurement challenge. The
Cerberus PA-RoT generates a secure asymmetric key pair unique to the
microcontroller closely following the DICE architecture. Private keys
are inaccessible outside of the secure region of the Cerberus RoT. Key
generation and chaining follows the RIoT specification, described in
section: 9.3 DICE and RIoT Keys and Certificates. Derived platform alias
public keys are available for use in attestation and communication from
the AC-RoT's during the challenge handshake for establishing
communication.

### RSA/ECDSA Key Generation

The Cerberus platform Active RoT should support the Device Identifier
Composition Engine (DICE) architecture. In DICE, the Compound Device
Identifier (CDI) is used as the foundation for device identity and
attestation. Keys derived from the Unique Device Secret (UDS) and
measurement of first mutable code are used for data protection within
the microcontroller and attestation of upper firmware layers. The Device
Id asymmetric key pair is derived cryptographically from the CDI and
associated with the Device Id Certificate. The CDI uses the UDS derived
from PUF and other random entropy including the microcontroller unique
id and Firmware Security Descriptors.

Cerberus implements the RIoT Core architecture for certificate
generation and attestation. For details on key generation on DICE and
RIoT, review section: 9.3 DICE and RIoT Keys and Certificates.

Note: The CDI is a compound key based on the UDS, Microcontroller
Security Descriptors and second stage bootloader (mutable) measurement.
The second stage bootloader is mutable code, but not typically updated
with firmware updates. Changes to the second stage bootloader will
result in a different CDI, resulting in different asymmetric Device Id
key generation. Certificates associated with the previous Device key
will be invalidated and a new Certificate would need to be signed.

A second asymmetric key pair certificate is created in the RIoT Core
layer of Cerberus and passed to the Cerberus Application firmware. This
key pair forms the Alias Certificate and is derived from the CDI,
Cerberus Firmware Security Descriptor and measurement of the next stage
Cerberus Firmware.

Proof-of-knowledge of the CDI derived private key known as the Device Id
private key is used as a building-block in a cryptographic protocol to
identify the device. The Device Id private key is used to sign the Alias
Certificate, thus verifying the integrity of the key. During initial
provisioning, the Device Id Certificate is CA signed by the Microsoft
Certificate Authority. When provisioned, the Device Id keys must match
the previously signed public key.

<!-- TODO: ![](media/image4.png) -->

Note: The CDI and Device Id private key are security erased before
exiting RIoT Core.

<!-- TODO ![](media/image5.png) -->

Each layer of the software can use its
private key certificate to sign and issue a new certificate for the next
layer, each successive layer continues this chain. The certificate in
the application layer (Alias Certificate) can be used when
authenticating with devices and establishing a secure channel. The
certificate can also establish authenticity. Non-application layer
private keys used to sign certificates must be accessible only to the
layer they are generated. The Public keys are persisted or passed to
upper layers, and eventually exchanged with upstream and downstream
entities.

### Chained Measurements

The Cerberus firmware measurements are based on the Device Identifier
Composition Engine (DICE) architecture:
<https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/work-groups/dice-architectures>

The first mutable code on the RoT is the Second Bootloader (SBL). The
CDI is a measurement of the HMAC(Device Secret Key + Entropy, H(SBL)).
This measurement then passes to the second stage boot loader, that
calculates the digest of the Third Bootloader (TBL). On the Cerberus RoT
this is the Application Firmware: HMAC(CDI, H(TBL)).

<!-- TODO ![](media/image7.png) -->

<!-- TODO ![](media/image8.png) -->

The Third Stage Bootloader (TBL) which
runs the Cerberus Application Firmware will take additional area
measurements of the SPI/QSPI flash for the Processor it protects,
measuring both active and inactive areas. The TBL measurements are
verified and extended with an attestation freshness seed. The final
measurement is signed, sealed, and made available to the challenge
software.

Seeds for attesting firmware by the application firmware can be extended
from Cerberus Firmware measurements, or using the Alias Certificates a
dedicated freshness seed can be provided for measuring the protected
processor firmware.

The measurements are stored in either firmware or hardware register
values within the PA-RoT. The seed is typically transferred to the
device using the Device Cert, Alias Cert or Attestation Cert.

# Protocol and Hierarchy

The following section describes the capabilities and required protocol
and Application Programming Interface (API) of the motherboard's
Platform Active RoT (PA-RoT) and Active Component to establish a
platform level RoT. The Cerberus Active RoT and Active Component RoTs
are required to support the following I2C protocol.

The protocol is derived from the MCTP SMBus/I2C Transport Binding
Specification. A limited version of the protocol is defined for devices
that do not support MCTP. If an AC-RoT implements the Attestation
Protocol over MCTP, it may also optionally implement the minimum
attestation protocol over native SMBus/I2C.

### Attestation Message Interface

The Attestation Message Interface uses the MCTP over I2C message
protocol for transporting the Attestation payloads. The AC-RoT MCTP
Management Endpoint should implement the required behaviors detailed in
the Management Component Transport Protocol (MCTP) Base Specification,
in relation to the MCTP SMBus/I2C Transport Binding Specification. The
following section outlines additional requirements upon the expected
behavior of the Management Endpoint:

-   The Message Interface Request and Response Messages are transported
    with a custom message type.

-   MCTP messages will be transmitted in a synchronous Request and
    Response manner only. An Endpoint (AC-RoT) should never initiate a
    Request Message to the Controller (PA-RoT).

-   MCTP Endpoints must strictly adhere to the response timeout defined
    in this specification. When an Endpoint receives a standard message,
    it should be transmitting the response within 100ms. If the Endpoint
    has not begun transmitting the Response Message within 100ms, it
    should drop the message and not respond.

-   MCTP Endpoints must strictly adhere to the response timeout
    advertised for cryptographic commands. Cryptographic commands
    include transmission of messages signature generation and
    verification. The cryptographic command timeout multiplier is
    negotiated in the Device Capabilities command.

-   MCTP leaves Authentication to the application implementation. This
    specification partially follows the flow of USB Authentication
    Specification flow, when authentication has been established
    attestation seeds can be exchanged.

-   It is not required that the Management Endpoint response to ARP
    messages. AC-RoT Endpoints should not generate any ARP messages to
    Notify Master. Devices should be aware they are normally behind I2C
    muxes and should not master the I2C bus outside of the allotted time
    they are provided to response to an MCTP Request Message.

-   MCTP Endpoint devices should be response only.

-   Irrespective as to whether Endpoints are ARP capable, they should
    operate in a Non-ARP-capable manner.

-   MCTP specifications use big endian byte ordering while this
    specification uses little endian byte ordering. This ordering does
    not change the payload order in which bytes are sent out on the
    physical layer.

-   Endpoints should support Fixed Addresses; Endpoint IDs are supported
    to permit multiple MCTP Endpoints behind a single physical address.

-   As defined in the MCTP SMBus/I2C Transport Binding Specification
    Endpoints should support fast-mode 400KHz.

-   Endpoint devices that do not support multi-master should operate in
    slave mode. The PA-RoT PCD will identify the mode of the device. The
    Master will issue SMBUS Write Block in MCTP payload format, the
    master will then issue an I2C Read for the response. The Master read
    the initial 12 bytes and use byte 3 and the MCTP EOM header bits to
    determine if additional SMBUS read commands are required to collect
    the remainder of the response message.

-   Endpoints should support EID assignment using the MCTP Set Endpoint
    ID control message.

-   Endpoints should support the MCTP Get Vendor Defined Message Support
    control message to indicate support level for the Cerberus protocol.

The Platform Cerberus Active RoT is always the MCTP master. Active
Component RoT's can be configured as Endpoint, or Endpoint and Master.
An Active Component RoT Endpoint and Master should interface to separate
physical busses. There is no requirement for master arbitration as
master and slave definitions are hierarchically established. The only
hierarchy whereby the Active Component RoT becomes both Endpoint and
Master is when there is a downstream sub-device, such as the Host Bus
Adapter (HBA) depicted in the following block diagram:

<!-- TODO ![](media/image10.png) -->

In this diagram, the HBA RoT is an Endpoint to the Platform Active RoT
and Master to the downstream HBA Expanders. To the Platform's Active
RoT, the HBA is an Endpoint RoT. To the HBA Expanders, the HBA
Controller is a Master RoT.

The messaging protocol encompasses Management Component Transport
Protocol (MCPT) Base Specification, in relation to the MCTP SMBus/I2C
Transport Binding Specification, whereby the Active Component RoT is
Endpoint and the Platform's Active RoT as Master.

### Protocol Format

All MCTP transactions are based on the SMBus Block Write bus protocol.
The following diagram shows MCTP encapsulated message.

<!-- TODO ![](media/image11.png) -->

A package should contain a minimum of 1 byte of payload, with the
maximum not to exceed the negotiated MCTP Transmission Unit Size. The
byte count indicates the number of subsequent bytes in the transaction,
excluding the PEC.

The PEC at the end of each transaction is calculated using a standard
CRC-8, which uses polynomial x^8^ + x^2^ + x + 1, initial value of 0,
and final XOR of 0. This CRC is independent of the message integrity
check defined by the MCTP protocol. The CRC is calculated over the
entire encapsulated MCTP packet, which includes all headers and the
destination I2C address as it was sent over the I2C bus (bytes 1 through
N in Figure 7 MCTP Encapsulated Message). Since the I2C slave address is
not typically included as part of the transaction data, the CRC is equal
to CRC8 (7-bit address \<\< 1 \|\| I2C payload). For example, an MCTP
packet sent to a device with 7-bit I2C address 0x41 would have a CRC
calculated as CRC8 (0x82 \|\| packet).

### Packet Format

The Physical Medium-Specific Header and Physical Medium-Specific Trailer
are defined by the MCTP\
transport binding specification utilized by the port. Refer to the MCTP
transport binding specifications.

A compliant Management Endpoint shall implement all MCTP required
features defined in the MCTP base specification.

The base protocol's common fields include message type field that
identifies the higher layer class of message being carried within the
MCTP protocol.

### Transport Layer Header

<!-- !TODO [](media/image12.png) -->

The Management Component Transport Protocol (MCTP) Base Specification
defines the MCTP packet header (refer to DSP0236 for field
descriptions). The fields of an MCTP Packet are shown in Table 1 Field
Definitions.

Table 1 Field Definitions

| **Field Name**          | **Description**         | **Field Size** |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|----------------|
| Medium-Specific Header  | This represents the header for the protocol that encapsulates MCTP packets over a physical medium | Variable |
| Medium-Specific Trailer | This represents the trailer fields for the protocol that encapsulates MCTP packets over a physical medium | Variable |
| MCTP Transport Header   | Provides version and addressing for the packet. | 32 bits |
| RSVD                    | Reserved | 4 bits |

| Message Integrity Check | Message type specific integrity check over the contest of the message body. | Variable |

Null (0) Source and Destination EIDs are typically supported, however
AC-RoT devices that have multiple MCTP Endpoints may specify an EID
value greater than 7 and less than 255. The PA-RoT does not broadcast
any MCTP messages.

### MCTP Messages

An MCTP message consists of one or more MCTP packets. There are
typically two types of Messages, MCTP Control Messages and MCTP Cerberus
Messages. Control Messages are standard MCTP messages with a maximum
message body of 64 bytes. Cerberus Messages are those defined in this
specification. The maximum message body for these messages is 4096
bytes, but this size can be negotiated to be smaller based on device
capabilities.

MCTP Control Messages do not contain the per-packet CRC described in
section 3.2.

#### Message Type

The message type should be 0x7E as per the Management Component
Transport Protocol (MCTP) Base Specification. The message type is used
to support Vendor Defined Messages where the Vendor is identified by the
PCI based Vendor ID. The initial message header is specified in the
Management Component Transport Protocol (MCTP) Base Specification, and
detailed below for completeness:

| Message Header | Byte | Description |
| -------------- | ---- | ----------- |
| Request Data   | 1:2  | PCI/PCIe Vendor ID. The MCTP Vendor Id formatted per 00h Vendor ID format offset. |
|                | 3:N  | Vendor-Defined Message Body. 0 to N bytes. |
| Response Data  | 1:2  | PCI/PCIe Vendor ID, the value is formatted per 00h Vendor ID offset. |
|                | 3:M  | Vendor-Defined Message Body. 0 to M bytes. |

The Vendor ID is a 16-bit Unsigned Integer, described in the PCI 2.3
specification. The value identifies the device manufacturer.

The message body and content are described in Table 4 MCTP Message
Format.

#### Message Fields

The format of the MCTP message consists of a message header in the first
two bytes, followed by the message data, and ending with the Message
Integrity Check.

The Message header contains a Message Type (MT) field and Integrity
Check (IC) that are defined by the MCTP Base Specification. The Message
Type field indicate

#### Message Integrity Check

The Message Integrity Check field contains a 32-bit CRC computed over
the contents of the message

#### Packet Assembly into Messages

An MCTP message may be split into multiple MCTP Packet Payloads and sent
as a series of packets. Refer to the MCTP Base Specification for
packetization and message assembly rules.

#### Request Messages

Request Messages are messages that are generated by a Master MTCP
Controller and sent to an MCTP Endpoint. Request Messages specify an
action to be performed by the Endpoint. Request Messages are either
Control Messages or Cerberus Messages.

#### Response Messages

Response Messages are messages that are generated when an MCTP Endpoint
completes processing of a previously issued Request Message. The
Response Message must be completed within the allocated time or
discarded.

### EID Assignment

The BMC will assign EIDs to the different Active Component RoT devices.
All Active Component RoT devices should support the MCTP Set Endpoint ID
control request and response messages. The Platform Active RoT will have
a static EID of 0x0B.

# Certificates

The PA-RoT and AC-Rot will have a minimum of two certificates: Device Id
Certificate (typically CA signed by offline CA) and the Alias
Certificate (signed by the Device Id Certificate). The PA-RoT may also
have an additional Attestation Certificate signed by the Device Id
Certificate.

Certificates follow the 9.3 DICE and RIoT Keys and Certificates.

### Format

All Certificates shall use the X509v3 ASN.1 structure. All Certificates
shall use binary DER encoding for ASN.1. All Certificates shall be
compliant with RFC5280. To facilitate certificate chain authentication,
Authority and Subject Key Identifier extensions must be present. Further
certificate requirements are defined in the 9.3 DICE and RIoT Keys and
Certificates. Extensions beyond those required by RFC5280 or DICE are
allowed so long as they conform to the appropriate standards. Custom
extensions must be marked non-critical.

#### Textual Format

All text ASN.1 objects contained within Certificates, shall be specified
as either a UTF8String, PrintableString, or IA5String. The length of any
textual object shall not exceed 64 bytes excluding the DER type and DER
length encoding.

#### Distinguished Name

The distinguished name consists of many attributes that uniquely
identify the device. Distinguished name uniqueness can be accomplished
by including attributes such as the serial number.

#### Object Identifier

Object Identifier should follow 9.3 DICE and RIoT Keys and Certificates

#### Serial Number

As per 9.3 DICE and RIoT Keys and Certificates, the Certificate *Serial
Numbers* MUST be statistically unique per-Alias Certificate.

If the security processor has an entropy source, an 8-octet random
number MAY be used.

If the security processor has does not have an entropy source, then an
8-octet *Serial Number* MAY be generated using a cryptographically
secure key derivation function based on a secret key, such as those
described in SP800-108 \[9.6 NIST Special Publication 800-108\]. The
*Serial Number* MUST be unique for each generated certificate. For the
Alias Certificate, this SHOULD be achieved by incorporating the FWID
into the key derivation process (e.g. as the *Context* value in
SP-800-108)

If the 8-octet serial number generated is not a positive number, it may
be padded with an additional octet to maintain compliance with RFC5280.

### Certificate Chain

The maximum Certificate Chain Size is 4096 bytes. There is no additional
encoding necessary for the certificate chain as each certificate can be
retrieved individually.

The certificate recommended cryptographic methods for interoperability
are defined in Table 3 Recommended Algorithms for Interoperability

| **Method** | **Use** |
| ---------- | ------- |
| X509v3, DER encoding | Certificate format |
| ECDSA, NIST P256, secp256r1 curve, uncompressed point | Digital signing of Certificate |
| SHA256 | Hash algorithm |

# Authentication

Authentication is the process used to establish trust in a specific
device and prove integrity of the device firmware. Once a device is
authenticated, a secure session can optionally be established to provide
confidentiality. For some devices, a secure session can also be used to
enable a cryptographic binding that can be used for additional security
or to enable additional functionality.

A device only needs to support a single session from another endpoint.
In single session devices, the establishment of a new session will
supersede and terminate the existing session to permit the new session.
The previous session will be terminated upon receiving an out of session
(unencrypted) Get Digests request specifying a requested key exchange.
Get Digests requests received in session (encrypted) or without
requesting key exchange will not cause the active session to terminate.

### PA-RoT and AC-RoT Authentication

Devices are authenticated using the Alias certificate chain and signed
firmware measurements. The certificate chain is endorsed by the
Certificate Authority signing the Device Id Certificate. The certificate
hierarchy is explained in the TCG [Implicit Identity Based Device
Attestation](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/TCG-DICE-Arch-Implicit-Identity-Based-Device-Attestation-v1-rev93.pdf)
Reference.

The certificate authentication flow closely follows the USB
Authentication Architecture and Authentication Messages. The command
structures defined in this specification are derived from the USB-C
Authentication Protocol. Relevant sections of the specification are as
follows:

Section 3 Authentication Architecture of USB Authentication
Specification

Section 4 Authentication Protocol of USB Authentication Specification

Section 5 Authentication Messages of USB Authentication Specification

The authentication sequence starts with the master (e.g. PA-RoT) issuing
a Get Digests command. The slave (e.g. AC-RoT) responds with a list of
SHA256 hashes for each certificate in the device's Alias certificate
chain. If the master has cached the certificate chain, it may optionally
skip requesting these certificates.

If the master does not have the correct certificates, it will issue a
Get Certificate request for each certificate in the slave's Alias
certificate chain. The slave will respond with the requested
certificates, which must have origination from a trusted CA.

The master will verify the Alias certificate chain of the slave. If
verification fails or the certificate has been revoked, the
authentication will fail. The PA-RoT and AC-RoT can be updated with
revocation patches, see firmware update specification for further
details.

Once the certificate chain has been authenticated, the master will
verify firmware integrity through the Challenge request. The slave will
generate a Challenge response signed with its Alias key which includes
the measurement of device firmware. The master can verify this
measurement against a Component Firmware Manifest (CFM) or some other
reference to confirm the firmware is valid.

#### Authentication Sequence

1.  Master issues Get Digests command for Slot 0

2.  Slave responds with digests for the Alias certificate chain

3.  For each certificate in the chain, Master checks if the certificate
    has been cached

4.  If the certificate has not been cached, Master issues Get
    Certificate request

5.  Slave responds with the request certificate

6.  Master verifies the Alias certificate chain against a trusted root
    CA

7.  Master issues Challenge command containing a nonce (RN1)

8.  Slave generates a response containing

    -   Random nonce (RN2)

    -   Collective firmware measurement (PMR0)

    -   Signature over request/response pair using the Alias key

9.  Master verifies the signature and firmware measurement

### Secure Session Establishment

Cerberus devices may optionally support secure session establishment to
provide confidentiality between two devices or between external data
center software and the device. Session establishment leverages the
basic authentication flow with an additional key exchange to establish
the secure session. Device authentication uses the identity certificate
chain, while the session key exchange is based on ephemeral ECDH keys.
The Device Capabilities command will determine if a device supports
secure sessions.

After querying the for the device capabilities, the master will begin
the authentication sequence by issuing a Get Digests request. When using
authentication to establish a secure session, the Digests request will
also indicate the type of key exchange that will be ultimately be used.
If the device does not support the requested key exchange, it will
respond with an error.

After authentication has completed, the master will generate an
ephemeral key and send it to the slave. The slave will generate its own
ephemeral session key and complete the key exchange. Session keys will
be derived by running ECDH and subsequent KDFs over the session keys and
nonces that were included in the challenge.

The KDF used for deriving session and HMAC keys is NIST SP800-108
Counter Mode. Session state is volatile. Each end of the session must be
able to handle a loss of session context and support session
re-establishment.

#### Session Establishment Sequence

The session establishment flow starts with standard authentication
described is Section 5.1.1. Once the slave has been authenticated, the
key exchange is used to establish the session.

1.  Master generates an ephemeral ECC key pair and sends a Key Exchange
    request with Type 0 that includes the public key (PKreq).

2.  Slave generates an ephemeral ECC key pair of equivalent strength
    (PKresp).

3.  Slave generates a 256-bit AES session key (K~S~) using NIST
    SP800-108 Counter Mode

    a.  K~I~ = ECDH (PKreq, PKresp)

    b.  Label = RN1

    c.  Context = RN2

    d.  r = 32

4.  Slave generates a 256-bit MAC key (K~M~) using NIST SP800-108
    Counter Mode

    a.  K~I~ = ECDH (PKreq, PKresp)

    b.  Label = RN2

    c.  Context = RN1

    d.  r = 32

5.  Slave sends a Key Exchange response that includes:

    a.  The slave session public key (PKresp).

    b.  A signature using the Alias key over PKreq and PKresp.

    c.  An HMAC of its Alias key certificate using K~M~.

6.  Master generates the same session and MAC keys using the public key
    in the Key Exchange response.

7.  Master validates the signature and HMAC on the response.

8.  Messages can now be encrypted with 256-bit AES-GCM using the shared
    session key.

### Secure Device Binding

In some scenarios, it is necessary to have an additional level of
authentication between the devices. This additional authentication
mechanism is used to pair two devices such that replacement of either
device would be detected. Detection of unauthorized part replacement is
flagged as a security violation.

The binding comes from an additional KDF run on the session key to
derive the final session key. Each device partaking in the tightly
coupled pairing contain a common HMAC key that is used in a KDF to
device the paired session key. This common HMAC key is derived from
session data available the first time the two devices establish a secure
session.

#### Secure Device Binding Sequence

A paired session with device binding begins with a standard secure
session. Once the session has been established, an additional key
exchange is used to update the session key. This additional key exchange
must be encrypted.

1.  Master loads the pairing key (K~P~)

    a.  If this is the first pairing request, the Master generates the
        key using NIST SP800-108 Counter Mode

        i.  K~I~ = K~S~

        ii. Label = pairing

        iii. No Context

        iv. r = 32

    b.  If the Master has already been paired to the Slave, the Master
        loads key from secure storage.

2.  Master generates a new session key (K~S'~) using NIST SP800-108
    Counter Mode.

    a.  K~I~ = K~P~

    b.  Label = K~S~

    c.  No Context

    d.  r = 32

3.  Master sends a Key Exchange request with Type 1 that includes the
    length and HMAC of the pairing key using K~M~. This message is
    encrypted with the current session key (K~S~).

4.  Slave loads K~P~

    a.  If this is the first paring request from this Master, the Slave
        generates the key using the same inputs as the Master.

    b.  If the Slave has already paired with the Master, the Slave loads
        the key from secure storage.

5.  Slave calculates the pairing key HMAC and compares it to the
    received data.

6.  If this is the first paring request from this Master, Slave securely
    stores K~P~.

7.  Slave generates a new session key (K~S'~).

8.  Slave generates a Key Exchange response encrypted with K~S'~.

9.  Master verifies the response using K~S'~. Failure to decrypt with
    K~S'~ will require the Master to decrypt with K~S~ since the Slave
    will not update the session key on failure.

10. The secure session continues using K~S'~. Messages encrypted with
    K~S~ will not be processed by either side.

# Command Format

The following section describes the MCTP message format to support the
Authentication and Challenge and Attestation protocol. The
Request/Response message body describes the Vendor Defined MCTP message
encapsulated inside the MCTP transport. This section does not describe
the MCTP Transport Header, which includes the MCTP Header Version,
Destination Endpoint ID and other fields as defined by MCTP protocol.
The MCTP message encapsulation is described in section 3.2

The MCTP Get Vendor Defined Message Support command enables discovery of
what Endpoint vendor defined messages are supported. The discovery
identifies the vendor organization and defined messages types. The
format of this request is described in the MCTP base protocol
specification.

For the Cerberus protocol, the following information shall be returned
in response to the MCTP Get Vendor Defined Message Support request:

-   Vendor ID Format = 0

-   PCI Vendor ID = 0x1414

-   Command Set Version = 4

### Attestation Protocol Format

The messages from PA-RoT to AC-RoT will have the following fields

| Field Name          | Description |
| ------------------- | ----------- |
| IC                  | (MCTP integrity check bit) Indicates whether the MCTP message is covered by an overall MCTP message payload integrity check. |
| Message Type        | Indicates MCTP Vendor defined message. |
| MCTP PCI Vendor     | Id for PCI Vendor. Cerberus messages use the Microsoft PCI ID of 0x1414. |
| Request Type        | This field indicates what type of request is contained in the message. Messages defined in this specification shall have this bit set to 0. Setting this bit to 1 provides a mechanism, aside from different vendor IDs, to support a device-specific command set. Devices that don't have any additional command support will return an error if this bit is 1. |
| Crypt               | Message Payload and Command are encrypted. |
| Command             | The command ID for command to execute. |
| Msg Integrity Check | This field represents the optional presence of a message type-specific integrity check over the contents of the message body. If present (indicated by IC bit) the Message integrity check field is carried in the last bytes of the message body. |

The protocol header fields are to be included only in the first packet
of a multiple packet MCTP message. After reconstruction of the message
body, the protocol header will be used to interpret the message
contents. Reserved fields must be set to 0.

#### Encrypted Messages

If the crypt field is set in the protocol header, the message body
contains encrypted data. The command code byte and full message payload,
reconstructed from individual MCTP packets, is encrypted. The session
establishment flow described in section 5 is used to generate the
encryption keys. An encrypted message will have a 16-byte GCM
authentication tag and 12-byte initialization vector in plaintext at the
end of the message body. The following table shows the body of an
encrypted Cerberus message, with the encryption trailer. Segments shaded
in grey indicate ciphertext, and white indicate plaintext.

### Command Set Type Code

The type codes associated with the commands determine whether the
command can be executed outside of an obfuscated session:

| **Type** | **Description** |
| -------- | --------------- |
| 1        | Accepted inside or outside session. |
| 2        | Authentication and session setup commands. |
| 3        | Session required commands, obfuscated by session encryption or KDF, message body content is normally scrambled. |
| 8xh      | Any of the other command types, but the command uses the timeout allowed for Cryptographic commands. |

### RoT Commands

The following table describes the commands defined under this
specification. There are three categories: (1) Required commands (R)
that are mandatory for all implementations, (2) Optional commands (O)
that may be utilized if the specific implementation requires it, (3)
Master commands (M) that are required for all implementations that can
act as an attestation master for slave devices. All MCTP commands are
master initiated. The following section describes the command codes.

### Message Body Structures

The following section describes the structures of the MCTP message body.

### Error Message

The error command is returned for command responses when the command was
not completed as proposed, it also acts as a generic status for commands
without response whereby "No Error" code would indicate success. The Msg
Tag, Seq and Command match the response to the corresponding request.
The Message Body is returned as follows:


| **Payload** |  **Description** |
| ----------- | ---------------- |
| 1           | Error Code       |
| 2:5         | Error Data       |

| **Error Code**  | **Value** | **Description** | **Data**       |
| --------------- | --------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| No Error        | 0h        | Success \[Reserved in USB Type C Authentication Specification\] | 00h |
| Invalid Request | 01h       | Invalidated data in the request | 00h |
| Busy            | 03h       | Device cannot response as it is busy processing other commands | 00h |
| Unspecified     | 04h       | Unspecified error occurred | Vendor defined |
| Reserved        | 05h-EFh   | Reserved        | Reserved |
| Invalid Checksum | F0h      | Invalid checksum | Checksum |
| Out of Order Message | F1h  | EOM before SOM  | 00h |
| Authentication  | F2h       | Authentication not established | 00h |
| Out of Sequence Window | F3h | Message received out of Sequence Window | 00h |
| Invalid Packet Length | F4h | Packet received with unexpected size | Packet Length  |
| Message Overflow | F5h       | Message exceeded maximum length | Message Length |

If an explicit response is not defined for the command definitions in
the following sections, the Error Message is the expected response with
"No Error". The Error Message can occur as the response for any command
that fails processing.

### Firmware Version

This command gets the target firmware the version.

| ----------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 1           | Area Index:                              |
|             | 00h = Entire Firmware                    |
|             | 01h = RIoT Core                          |
|             | Additional indexes are firmware specific |

| **Payload** | **Description** |
| ----------- | --------------- |
| 1:32        |  Firmware Version Number ASCII Formatted |

### Device Capabilities

Device Capabilities provides information on device functionality. The
message and packet maximums are negotiated based on the shared
capabilities. Some additional considerations apply when determining
appropriate maximum sizes:

1.  Per the MCTP specification, the packet payload size must be no less
    than 64 bytes.

2.  Per section 3.5, the message payload size must be no more than 4096
    bytes.

3.  The total packet size supported by the device will include the
    encapsulation defined in section 3.2, excluding the first byte of
    destination address. For example, a maximum packet payload of 247
    bytes will result in 256 bytes being transmitted for every packet: 1
    byte destination address, 3 bytes SMBus header, 4 bytes MCTP header,
    247 bytes payload, and 1 byte CRC-8.

4.  Some commands do not support being separated across messages.
    Devices must support a maximum message size that is compatible with
    the expected payloads for supported commands.

5.  Master devices, such as PA-RoTs, should support the maximum message
    size of 4096 bytes to ensure full compatibility with any slave
    device.

device. Each import command sends a single certificate in the chain to
the device, and there is no requirement on the order in which these
certificates must be imported. Upon verification of a complete chain,
the device is sealed, and no further imports can occur without changes
to firmware. A response message is returned before certificate chain
validation has been performed with the new certificate and only
indicates if the certificate was accepted by the device. The complete
state of certificate provisioning can be queried with the Get
Certificate State request.

Upon receiving a certificate, the device will start to authenticate the
stored certificate chain. When sending multiple certificates, it may be
necessary to ensure the previous authentication step has completed
before sending a new certificate. The authentication status can be
checked with the Get Certificate State command.

### Get Certificate State

Determine the state of the certificate chain for signed certificates
that have been sent to the device. The request for this command contains
no additional payload.

|             | 2 = The stored chain is being validated.      |
| 2:4         | Error details if chain validation has failed. |

### GET DIGESTS

This command is derived from the similar USB Type C-Authentication
Message. The Protocol Version byte is not included, the Message Type is
present in the Command byte of the MCTP message. See: Table 4 MCTP
Message Format. The response is different, since certificate handling
deviates from USB Type C, and the reserved bytes are repurposed.

This command can be sent at any time. If authentication was previously
established, this command will renegotiate/override the previous
authentication and session establishment. The byte 2, reserved USB Type
C -- authentication specification, is used to describe the key exchange
algorithm. This is relevant when the requester and responder support
multiple key exchange algorithms.

Slots that do not contain a valid certificate chain will generate a
response with 0 digests. Payload byte 2 will indicate that no digests
are returned.

| 1             | Capabilities Field; shall be set to 01 |
| 2             | The number of certificate digests returned. Each digest represents a single certificate in the chain, starting from the certificate closest to the root. |
| 3:N           | Digest\[0\] 32 byte SHA256 digest of the root Certificate in the Chain |
| N+            | Digest\[1\] 32 byte SHA256 digest of N Certificate in the Chain |

### GET CERTIFICATE

This command retrieves the public attestation certificate chain for the
AC-RoT. It follows closely the USB Type C Authentication Specification.

If the device does not have a certificate for the requested slot or
index, the certificate contents in the response will be empty.

| **Payload**   | **Description** |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1             | Param1: Slot Number of the target Certificate Chain to read. The value should be 0-7. |
| 2             | Certificate number. This a 0-based index starting with the root certificate in the chain. |
| 3:4           | Offset: offset in bytes from start of the Certificate chain where read request begins. |
| 5:6           | Length: number of bytes to read |


| **Payload**   | **Description** |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1             | Param1: Slot Number of the target Certificate Chain returned. |
| 2             | Certificate number of the returned certificate |
| 3:N           | Requested contents of target Certificate Chain. See section 4 Certificates. |

### CHALLENGE

The PA-RoT will send this command providing the first nonce in the key
exchange.

| **Payload**   | **Description** |

| 41+L:N        | Signature of combined request and response message payloads. See USB Type C Authentication Protocol for details of request/response signature. |

The firmware digests are measurements of the security descriptors and
the firmware of the target components. This firmware measurement data
does not include Cerberus PCD, CFM or PFM. These measurements are
returned in PMR1. The numbers are retrieved in the 6.44 Get
Configuration Ids. The USB-C Context Hash is not included in the
CHALLENGE. This is replaced with contextual measurements for the device.
Note: The attestation Certificate derivation will include the
measurement of firmware and security descriptors. PMR0 is anticipated to
be the least changing PMR as it contains the measurement of security
descriptors and device initial boot loader.

### Key Exchange

Key Exchange is used to establish an encrypted channel with a device.
The session establishment flow is detailed in Section 5 Authentication.

Upon receiving this message with Key Type 0, both sides can establish an
encrypted session. If Key Type 1, the paired key is also compared, and
paired functionality is unlocked if verified to match the expected key.
The Key Type 1 can only be performed under an encrypted session, as the
session key is required for the HMAC. When initially calculating a
pairing key (K~P~) for device binding, the HMAC specified in the Key
Type 0 request for the session will be used with the KDF.

When closing an established session (Key Type 2), the response will be
transmitted in plain text if the session was successfully terminated.

| 5:8           | Attestation Log (02h) Length in bytes |
| 9:12          | Tamper Log (03h) Length in bytes |

### Get Log

Get the internal log for the RoT. There are 3 types of logs available:
The Debug Log, which contains Cerberus application information and
machine state. The Attestation measurement log, this log format is like
the TCG log, and the Tamper log. It is not possible to clear or reset
the tamper counter.


| **Log Type**   | **Description** |
| -------------- | ----------------- |
| 1              | Debug Log |
| 2              | Attestation Log |
| 3              | Tamper Log |

| **Payload**   | **Description** |
| ------------- | ----------------- |
| 1             | Log Type |
| 2:5           | Offset |

| **Payload**   | **Description** |
| ------------- | ------------------------- |
| 1:N           | The contents of the log |

Length determined by end of log, or packet size based on device
capabilities see section: 6.7 Device Capabilities. If response spans
multiple MCTP messages, end of response will be determined by an MCTP
message which has a payload less than maximum payload supported by both
devices. To guarantee a response will never fall exactly on the max
payload boundary, the responder must send back an extra packet with zero
payload.

#### Attestation Log Format

The attestation log will report individual measurements for all
components of each PMR. Each measurement will be a single entry in the
log. The entire log consists of each entry sequentially concatenated.
The structure of the entry closely resembles TCG events. See TCG PC
Client Platform Firmware Profile Specification.

| **Offset** | **Description**                                     |

| 20:21        | Digest algorithm Id (0x0B, SHA256) |
| 22:53        | SHA256 digest used to extend the measurement |
| 54:57        | Measurement size (32) |
| 58:89        | Measurement |

#### Debug Log Format

The debug log reported by the device has no specified format, as this
can vary between different devices and it is not necessary for
attestation. It is expected that diagnostic utilities for the device
will be able to understand the exposed log information. A recommended
entry format is provided here.

| **Offset**   | **Description** |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1:7          | Log Entry Header |

| 12           | Identifier for the entry message |
| 13:16        | Message specific argument |
| 17:20        | Message specific argument |

### Clear Debug/Attestation Log

Clear the log in the RoT.

| **Payload**   | **Description** |
| ------------- | ----------------- |
| 1             | Type: 01 or 02 |

Note: in clearing the attestation log, it is automatically recreated
using current measurements.

### Get Attestation Data

Get the raw data used to generate measurements reported in the
attestation log. Not all measurements will have raw data available, as
this is mostly intended for measurements generated over small amounts of
data or text. Requests for entries that don't provide the measured data
will generate a normal response with an empty payload. Requests for
invalid entries will generate an error response.

While this command is intended to support small pieces of that data that
should fit into a single MCTP message, an offset parameter is included
in the request to support scenarios where the required data is too
large.

| **Payload**   | **Description** |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- |
| 1             | Platform Measurement Register |
| 2             | Entry Index |

|             | 01h -- Host is being held in reset                         |
|             | 02h -- Host is not being held in reset, but is not running |

### Get Platform Firmware Manifest Id

Retrieves PFM identifiers.

| **Payload**  | **Description**          |
|--------------|--------------------------|
| 1            | Port Id                  |

| ------------- | -------------------- |
| 1             | PFM Valid (0 or 1) |
| 2:5           | PFM Version Id |

  **Payload**   **Description**
  ------------- ------------------------------------------
  1             PFM Valid (0 or 1)
  2:N           PFM Platform Id as null-terminated ASCII

### Get Platform Firmware Manifest Supported Firmware 

| **Payload** | **Description** |
|-------------|-----------------|
| 1           | Port Id         |
| 2           | PFM Region:     |
|             | 0 = Active      |
|             | 1 = Pending     |
| 3:6         | Offset          |

|  **Payload**   | **Description** |

|  2:5           | PFM Version Id |
|  6:N           | PFM supported FW versions |

If response spans multiple MCTP messages, end of response will be
determined by an MCTP packet which has payload less than maximum payload
supported by both devices. To guarantee a response will never fall
exactly on the max payload boundary, the responder should send back an
extra packet with zero payload.

### Prepare Platform Firmware Manifest

Provisions RoT for incoming PFM.

| **Payload**   | **Description** |
| ------------- | ----------------- |
| 1             | Port Id |
| 2:5           | Total size |

### Update Platform Firmware Manifest

The flash descriptor structure describes the regions of flash for the
device.

| **Payload**   | **Description** |
| ------------- | ----------------- |
| 1             | Port Id |
| 2:N           | PFM Payload |

PFM payload includes PFM signature and monotonic forward only Id. PFM
signature is verified upon receipt of all PFM payloads. PFMs are
activated upon the activation command. Note if a system is rebooted
after receiving a PFM, the PFM is atomically activated. To activate
before reboot, issue the Activate PFM command.

### Activate Platform Firmware Manifest

Upon valid PFM update, the update command seals the PFM committal
method. If committing immediately, flash reads and writes should be
suspended when this command is issued. The RoT will master the SPI bus
and verify the newly updated PFM. This command can only follow a valid
PFM update.

| **Payload** | **Description** |
|-------------|-----------------|
| 1           | Port Id         |
| 2           | Activation:     |
|             | 0 = Reboot only |
|             | 1 = Immediately |

If reboot only has been issued, the option for "Immediately" committing
the PFM is not available until a new PFM is updated.

### Get Component Firmware Manifest Id

Retrieves the Component Firmware Manifest Id

| **Payload**  | **Description**          |
|--------------|--------------------------|
| 1            | CFM Region:              |

ERROR response zero is expected.

<!-- TODO: Table 77 -->

### Reset Configuration

Resets configuration parameters back to the default state. Depending on
the request parameters, different amounts of types of configuration can
be erased, and each type of configuration may require different levels
of authorization to complete.

If authorization is required for the operation to complete, the response
will contain a device-specific, one-time use, authorization token that
must be signed with the PFM key to unlock the operation. The
authorization token has the following behavior:

1.  A request for the same operation without providing the signed
    authorization token will generate a new token that invalidates any
    old token. This is true even if the old token has not been used yet.

2.  After an authorization token has been used to unlock an operation,
    it can never be used again. A new token must be requested. This is
    true even if the requested operation was not able to complete
    successfully.

3.  A failure to authorize the request when providing a signed token
    does not invalidate the current authorization token in the device.

If authorization is not required, or the request is sent with a signed
token, a standard error response will be returned indicating the status.

### Platform Measurement Register

Returns the Cerberus Platform Measurement Register (PMR), which is a
digest of the Cerberus Firmware, PFM, CFM and PCD. This information
contained in PMR0 is Cerberus firmware. PMR1-2 are reserved for
PFM/CFM/PCD and other configuration. PMR3-4 are reserved for external
usages.

Attestation requires that at least PMR0 be maintained, since that is the
measurement reported in the challenge response message. At a minimum,
PMR0 should contain any security configuration of the device and all
firmware components. This includes any firmware actively running as well
as firmware that was run to boot the device. For ease of attestation,
PMR0 is intended to only contain static information. If variable data
will also be measured, these measurements should be exposed through
PMR1-2.

The Seal/Unseal flow is described in the Cerberus Attestation
Integration specification.

Platform Active RoT (PA-RoT)
============================

The PA-RoT is responsible for challenging the AC-RoT's and collecting
their firmware measurements. The PA-RoT retains a private manifest of
active components that includes addresses, buses, firmware versions,
digests and firmware topologies.

The manifest informs the PA-RoT on all the Active Components in the
system. It provides their I2C addresses, and information on how to
verify their measurements against a known or expected state. Polices
configured in the Platform RoT determine what action it should take
should the measurements fail verification.

In the Cerberus designed motherboard, the PA-RoT orchestrates power-on.
Only Active Components listed in the challenge manifest, that pass
verification will be released from power-on reset.

### Platform Firmware Manifest (PFM) and Component Firmware Manifest

The PA-RoT contains a Platform Firmware Manifest (PFM) that describes
the firmware permitted on the Platform. The Component Firmware Manifest
(CFM) describes the firmware permitted for components in the Platform.
The Platform Configuration Data (PCD), specific to each SKU describes
the number of Component types in the platform and their respective
locations.

Note: The PFM and CFM are different from the boot key manifest described
in the Processor Secure Boot Requirements specification. The PFM and CFM
describe firmware permitted to run in the system across Platform and
Active Components. The CFM is a complement to the PFM, generated by the
PA-RoT for the measurement comparison of components in the system. This
complement is as the Reported Firmware Manifest (RFM), which is like the
TCG log. The PFM and RFM are stored encrypted in the PA-RoT. The
symmetric encryption key for the PA-RoT is hardware generated and unique
to each microcontroller. The symmetric key in the PA-Rot is not
exportable or firmware readable; and only accessible to the crypto
engine for encryption/decryption. The AES Galois/Counter Mode (GCM)
encryption a unique auditable tag to any changes to the manifest at both
an application level and persistent storage level.

The following table lists the attributes stored in the PFM for each
Active component:

|  **Attribute**           | **Description** |
|  ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  Description             | Device Part or Description |
|  Device Type             | Underlying Device Type of AC-RoT |
|  Remediation Policy      | Policy(s) defining default remediation actions for integrity failure. |
|  Firmware Version        | List of firmware versions |
|  Flash Areas/Offsets     | List of offset and digests, used and unused |
|  Measurement             | Firmware Measurements |
|  Measurement Algorithm   | Algorithm used to calculate measurement. |
|  Public Key              | Public keys in the key manifest |
|  Digest Algorithm        | Algorithm used to calculate |
|  Signature               | Firmware signature(s) |

The PA-RoT actively takes measurements of flash from platform firmware,
the PFM provides metadata that instructs the RoT on measurement and
signature verification. The PA-RoT stores the measurements in the RFM.
The PA-Rot then challenges the AC-RoTs for their measurements using the
Platform Configuration Data. it compares measurements from the AC-RoT's
to the CFM, while recording measurements in the RFM.

The measurements of the Platform firmware and Component firmware are
compared to the PFM and CFM. Should a mismatch occur, the PA-RoT would
raise an event log and invoke the policy action defined for the Platform
and/or Component. A variety of actions can be automated for a PFM/CFM
challenge failure. Actions are defined in the CFM and PCD files.

Note: The PA-RoT and AC-RoT enforce secure boot and only permit the
download of digitally signed and unrevoked firmware. A PFM or CFM
mismatch can only occur when firmware integrity is brought into
question.

### RoT External Communication interface

The PA-RoT connects to the platform through, either SPI, QSPI depending
on the motherboard. Although the PA-RoT physically connects to the SPI
bus, the microprocessor appears transparent to the host as it presents
only a flash interface. The management interface into the PA-RoT and
AC-RoTs is an I2C bus channeled through the Baseboard Management
Controller (BMC). The BMC can reach all AC-RoTs in the platform. The BMC
bridges the PA-RoT to the Rack Manager, which in-turn bridges the rack
to the Datacenter management network. The interface into the PA-RoT is
as follows:

<!-- TODO: Figure 12
[]{#_Toc47538543 .anchor}Figure 12 External Communication Interface

> ![](media/image16.png){width="4.965277777777778in"
> height="2.400944881889764in"}
-->

The Datacenter Management (DCM) software can communicate with the PA-RoT
Out-Of-Band (OOB) through the Rack Manager. The Rack Manager allows
tunneling through to the Baseboard Management Controller, which connects
to the PA-RoT over I2C. This channel is assumed insecure, which is why
all communicates are authenticated and encrypted. The Datacenter
Management Software can collect the RFM measurements and other challenge
data over this secure channel. Secure updates are also possible over
this channel.

### Host Interface

The host can communicate with the PA-RoT and AC-RoTs through the BMC
host interface. Similar to the OOB path, the BMC bridges the host-side
LPC/eSPI interface to the I2C interface on the RoT. The host through BMC
is an unsecure channel, and therefore requires authentication and
confidentiality.

### Out Of Band (OOB) Interface

The OOB interface is essential for reporting potential firmware
compromises during power-on. Should firmware corruption occur during
power-on, the OOB channel can communicate with the DCM software while
the CPU is held in reset. If the recovery policy determines the system
should remain powered off, it's still possible for the DCM software to
interrogate the PA-RoT for detailed status and make a determination on
the remediation.

The OOB communication to Cerberus requires TLS and Certificate
Authentication.

Legacy Interface
================

The legacy interface is defined for backward combability with devices
that do not support MCTP. These devices must provide a register set with
specific offsets for Device Capabilities, Receiving Alias Certificate,
accepting a Nonce, and providing an offset for Signed Firmware
Measurements. The payload structures will closely match that of the MCTP
protocol version. Legacy interfaces to no support session based
authentication but permit signed measurements.

Protocol Format
---------------

The legacy protocol leverages the SMBus Write/Read Word and Block
commands. The interface is register based using similar read and write
subroutines of I2C devices. The data transmit and receive requirements
are 32 bytes or greater. Large payloads can be truncated and retrieved
recursively spanning multiple block read or write commands.

The block read SMBUS command is specified in the SMBUS specification.
Slave address write and command code bytes are transmitted by the
master, then a repeated start and finally a slave address read. The
master keeps clocking as the slaves responds with the selected data. The
command code byte can be considered register space.

### PEC Handling

An SMBus legacy protocol implementation may leverage the 8bit SMBus
Packet Error Check (PEC) for transactional data integrity. The PEC is
calculated by both the transmitter and receiver of each packet using the
8-bit cyclic redundancy check (CRC-8) of both read or write bus
transaction. The PEC accumulates all bytes sent or received after the
start condition.

An Active RoT that receives an invalid PEC can optionally NACK the byte
that carried the incorrect PEC value or drop the data for the
transaction and any further transactions (read or write) until the next
valid read or write Start transaction is received.

### Message Splitting

The protocol supports Write Block and Read Block commands. Standard
SMBus transactions are limited to 32 bytes of data. It is expected that
some Active Component RoTs with intrinsic Cerberus capabilities may have
limited I2C message buffer designed around the SMBus protocol that limit
them to 32 bytes. To overcome hardware limitations in message lengths,
the Capabilities register includes a buffer size for determining the
maximum packet size for messages. This allows the Platform's Active RoT
to send messages larger than 32 bytes. If the Active Component RoT only
permits 32 bytes of data, the Platform's Active RoT can segment the Read
or Write Blocks into multiple packets totaling the entire message. Each
segment includes decrementing packet number that sequentially identifies
the part of the overall message. To stay within the protocol length each
message segment must be no longer than 255 bytes.

### Payload Format

The payload portions of the SMBus Write and Read blocks will encapsulate
the protocol defined in this specification. The SMBus START and STOP
framing and ACK/NACK bit conditions are omitted from this portion of the
specification for simplification. To review the specifics of START and
STOP packet framing and ACK/NACK conditions refer to the SMBus
specification.

The data blocks of the Write and Read commands will encapsulate the
message payload. The encapsulated payload includes a uint16 register
offset and data section.

### Register Format

The SMBUS command byte indexes the register, while additional writes
offsets index inside the register space. The offset and respective
response is encapsulated into the data portions of I2C Write and Read
Block commands. The PA-RoT is always the I2C master, therefore Write and
Read commands are described from the perspective of the I2C master.

Certain registers may contain partial or temporary data while the
register is being written across multiple commands. The completion or
sealing of register writes can be performed by writing the seal register
to the zero offset.

register space:

### Legacy Active Component RoT Commands

The following table describes the commands accepted by the Active
Component RoT. All commands are master initiated. The command number is
not representative of a contiguous memory space, but an index to the
respective register

| **Register Name**                 | **Command**   | **Length**   | **R/W**   | **Description** |
| --------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------ | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Status                            | 30h           | 2            | R         | Command Status |
| Firmware Version                  | 32h           | 16           | R/W       | Retrieve firmware version information |
| Device Id                         | 33h           | 8            | R         | Retrieves Device Id |
| Capabilities                      | 34h           | 9            | R         | Retrieves Device Capabilities |
| Certificate Digest                | 3C            | 32           | R         | SHA256 of Device Id Certificate |
| Certificate                       | 3D            | 4096         | R/W       | Certificate from the AC-Rot |
| Challenge                         | 3E            | 32           | W         | Nonce written by RoT |
| Platform Configuration Register   | 03h           | 5Eh          | R         | Reads firmware measurement, calculated with S Nonce |

### Legacy Command Format

The following section describes the register format for AC-RoT that do
not implement SMBUS and comply with the legacy measurement exchange
protocol.

#### Status

The SMBUS read command reads detailed information on error status. The
status register is issued between writing the challenge nonce and
reading the Measurement. The delay time for deriving the Measurement
must comply with the Capabilities command.

| **Payload** | **Description**    |
|-------------|--------------------|
| 1           | Status:            |
|             | > 00 = Complete    |
|             | > 01 In Progress   |
|             | > 02 Error         |
| 2           | Error Data or Zero |

#### Firmware Version

The SMBUS write command payload sets the index. The subsequent SMBUS
read command reads the response. For register payload description see
response: Table 11 Firmware Version Response

#### Device Id

> The SMBUS read command reads the response. For register payload
> description see response: Table 1 Field Definitions

#### Device Capabilities

The SMBUS read command reads the response. For register payload
description see response:

Table 13 Device Capabilities Response

#### Certificate Digest

The SMBUS read command reads the response. For register payload
description see response: Table 24 GET DIGEST Response

The PA-Rot will use the digest to determine if it has the certificate
already cached. Unlike MCTP, only the Alias and Device Id cert is
supported. Therefore, it must be CA signed by a mutually trusted CA, as
the CA Public Cert is not present

#### Certificate

The SMBUS write command writes the offset into the register space. For
register payload description see response: Table 26 GET CERTIFICATE
Response

#### Unlike MCTP, only the Alias and Device Id cert is supported. Therefore, it must be CA signed by mutually trusted CA, as the CA Public Cert is not present in the reduced challenge {#unlike-mctp-only-the-alias-and-device-id-cert-is-supported.-therefore-it-must-be-ca-signed-by-mutually-trusted-ca-as-the-ca-public-cert-is-not-present-in-the-reduced-challenge .list-paragraph}

The SMBUS write command writes a nonce for measurement freshness.

| **Payload**   | **Description** |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 1:32          | Random 32 byte nonce chosen by PA-RoT |

#### Measurement

The SMBUS read command that reads the signed measurement with the nonce
from the hallenge above. The PA-RoT must poll the Status register for
completion after issuing the Challenge and before reading the
Measurement.

| **Payload**   | **Description** |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1             | Length (L) of following hash digest. |
| 2:33          | H(Challenge Nonce \|\| H(Firmware Measurement/PMR0)) |
| 34:N          | Signature of HASH \[2:33\] |
